## Web3 Templating with NFT Storage

This project aims to implement a completely decentralized Templating Engine for managing a business' templated documents for anyone's daily use. These templates can be vary from Legal Documents like Privacy Policies, T&C Documens to custom built templates for a specific business need. The templates and documents created by users are stored on IPFS, making the entire solution completely decentralized in nature. 

### Use case
Various use cases for this service can be enumerated as:
1. Privacy Policy, T&C, EULA, Disclaimer etc. generators, making sure all templates and data are stored on the decentralized platforms. 
2. Sales Documentation and Reporting Templates Generator, keeping all templates and generated documents on the decentralized storage.
3. Web API Documentation Templates Generator, to plugin only the endpoints of an API and have the entire documentation up on the decentralized storage. 
4. Marketing Emails Templates Generator, for sending beautiful marketing emails with templates residing on decentralized storage platforms.
and so on.. 

### User Workflows
This dApp allows the users to perform the following operations: 
1. Any user can create and define a template based on his needs with any number of variables within the tempalte. This template is then stored on the decentralized storage platform and is available for any public use. Note: The dApp only supports text for now, but the plan is to support image and other media in the near future. 
2. Any user can select an existing template and fill in the required values to create a full fledged document, available on the decentrlized storage (NFT.Storage in this case)
